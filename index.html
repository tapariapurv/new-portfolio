            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I am Purv Taparia, a 9-year old student from Class 4 residing in Mumbai, India. I have coded this
                    portfolio to showcase my technical and creative abilities.</p>
                <p>I am deeply interested in coding and writing. I am proficient in creative writing and can write
                    descriptive paragraphs and essays. I am also quite fluent in English and possess a decent vocabulary
                    and understanding of grammar concepts.</p>
                <p>I have achieved International Rank 1 in the International English Olympiad conducted by the Science
                    Olympiad Foundation twice. I also have created many projects on Scratch.</p>
                <p>I also have many skills in fields such as Artificial Intelligence. I have used AI models such as Veo
                    3.1 to create production-class videos and models like Nano Banana Pro to create mesmerising images.
                    I can also use tools from Microsoft Office with ease such as Excel, PowerPoint, Word, etc.</p>
                <p>Along with this, I can also program in languages such as HTML and CSS and hold some knowledge about
                    languages such as Python and C++. I also understand simple programming logic such as if, else and
                    elif conditions and for and while loops. I also know about variables, lists, sets, tuples,
                    dictionaries, functions, etc.</p>
